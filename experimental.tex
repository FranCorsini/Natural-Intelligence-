\chapter{Experimental Setup}
To be able to do the experiment, several hardware are needed, namely:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Radio controlled car, including the controller
  \item Wireless camera, such as GoPro
  \item Screen
\end{itemize}

Aside from the hardware, a location, such as a maze or a track is also necessary. 

- miniature radio controlled car
- environment with high(relative to car) location-cues
- Batteries
- Car controller
- Way to intercept the driving signals
- GoPro?
- wormeye view
- track / maze

\section{Remote navigation}
- screen
- head mounted display?
- FOV closure/distortion stuff
- remove center / peripheral, letterboxes


\section{Measurements}
%the test combinations below have too many factors, so we need to think how to do this
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l|lllll|}
\hline
No & Vision  & Method distortion & Screen resolution & Screen distance & Screen size \\\hline
1  & Normal  & None              & ?                 & ?               & ?           \\
2  & Reduced & Letterbox?        & ?                 & ?               &             \\
3  & ...     & ...               & ...               & ...             & ...        \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Test combinations}
\end{table}

- time
- accuracy
- collision
- driver comfort level (This can be achieved by using questionnaires)
- Screen distance
- Screen resolution
- Screen Size
Reduced vs no-reduced.
